This package is inspired by [guid75/ziplist](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/guid75/ziplist/latest/) and Richard Feldman's conference [Making Impossible States Impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8).

This package is quite young and hasn't been thoroughly checked so you may have some bugs using it. If ever this happened post an issue on gh or make a pull request that solves it. Thaks!
